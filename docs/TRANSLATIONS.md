# Translations

The translations of the user interface, the template database and the user manual (which is still under development)
are maintained at [Fedora Weblate](https://translate.fedoraproject.org/projects/glabels-qt/). Please always use
Weblate for translation submissions; we do not accept contributions from outside this platform. For more information about
using Weblate, read the [documentation](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/).

To contribute to translations, you need an account in the [Fedora Account System](https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/).
More information about the account system can be found [here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-accounts/).
